# WaterQualityPrediction-Deployment
This is a machine learning web application built using Flask that predicts whether water is safe for drinking or not, based on key chemical properties. The model is trained on a publicly available dataset and deployed with a user-friendly interface to receive input and display predictions.
# User enters water sample data (pH, Sulfate, Solids, etc.)
# Inputs are scaled using a saved StandardScaler
# A trained Random Forest model predicts potability
# Result is displayed: ✅ Safe or ❌ Not Safe
# Users can also submit feedback that gets stored in feedback.csv
